# Placeholder for first Post   

This will eventually be a blog post, but for right now it is just a placeholder.   

3/31/2024 - I have not worked on this repo for a while and now I have to figure it out again. That is the problem with coding in general - you must work on coding everyday so it sticks in your long term memory.  

This line was created in the GH .dev window. This is what I will use for the Lubuntu computer. Instead of putting VS Code on the Lubuntu, I will just use the web developer UI.  

I think the browser dev saves automatically.
