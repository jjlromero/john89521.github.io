# Greetings  
The directions to this template are in the [directions.md](https://john89521.github.io/directions.html) file.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. 

This is the _index_ file and it appears like a landing page when the HTML is rendered.
