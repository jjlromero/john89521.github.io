# Greetings  
The directions to this template are in the [directions.md](https://john89521.github.io/directions.html) file.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. 

This is the _index_ file and it appears like a landing page when the HTML is rendered.  

The flow for this template:
- Open in GitHub.com.   
- Open in GitHub Desktop, then have Desktop open VS Code.  
- Edit or add files in VS Code.  
- Make commits in Desktop. 
- It takes about a minute for the Actions to run and incorporate the changes.  
- After Actions runs and green check marks display, refresh the web site to show changes.
