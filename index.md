# Greetings  
The directions to this template are in the [directions.md](https://john89521.github.io/directions.html) file.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. 

This is the _index_ file and it appears like a landing page when the HTML is rendered.  

The flow for this template:
1. Open GitHub.com.   
1. Open in GitHub Desktop, then have Desktop open VS Code.  
1. Edit or add files in VS Code.  
1. Make commits in Desktop. The **Push origin** button appears. 
1. It takes about a minute for the Actions to run and incorporate the changes.  
1. After Actions runs and green check marks display, refresh the web site to show changes.  

The finished product of this template is quite nice. [See it here](https://just-the-docs.com).  
One thing I like working with GitHub Desktop: it automatically sees my changes and gets them ready to push up to the repo.  One thing I do find clunky is waiting for Actions to go through it's motions. I imagine if the edits or changes are large, then Actions will take even longer. It goes back to the idea of commit often, which each change so you can at least get a SHA should you have to go back in time to correct something.
